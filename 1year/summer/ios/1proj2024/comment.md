# IOS 2024 1. Project: My Comments

This is my second version of the standard BASH project for this course (due to retake), and therefore more successful.
Evaluation: 14/15. 

The code may not be very readable due to the lack of comments, but in general it is not complicated.

I would advise you to learn to use AWK in addition to simple BASH to successfully pass such project. Feel free to ask questions to neural networks as well.

Here you can also see the tester (its not mine, but who cares).
